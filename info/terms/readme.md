### Hinge Loss

In machine learning, the hinge loss is a loss function used for training classifiers. The hinge loss is used for "maximum-margin" classification, most notably for support vector machines. 
Returns margins.

### Cross-entropy Loss

In information theory, the cross entropy between two probability distributions p and q over the same underlying set of events measures the average number of bits needed to identify an event drawn from the set, if a coding scheme is used that is optimized for an "unnatural" probability distribution q, rather than the "true" distribution p.
Returns probabilities.
